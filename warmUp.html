<h1>Warm Ups</h1>
<p> My ideal web development job would be working for a company related to the gaming industry.<br>
  I am hoping that I can continue working with FiveM or get a job with Rockstar Games to assist with creating scripts for mods that can be used in online servers. <br>
  I would love for my job to be very straight forward. I am given a coding task to complete and I complete it. <br>
  I want to be very hands-on, but have limited contact with people.</p>

<h2>SMART Goal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a better understanding of Javascript</li>
    <li>Graduate from CodeUp</li>
    <li>Obtain a job</li>
  </ul>
